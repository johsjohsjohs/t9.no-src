# Johanes Hove-Henriksen's Website

[https://t9.no](https://t9.no)

This is a my personal website! It uses [blogit](https://pedantic.software/git/blogit/) witch luke smith used on based.cooking after he moved to hugo [sadly](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/based.cooking/commit/c08fd719fe95604d245f3eb0d18b5b0c72c1308d). blogit is fine but i realy like to use somting "c" based bloging system because its faster.

I have been switching static site generator for a while. First i used [gohugo](gohugo.io), than [stagit](https://codemadness.org/stagit.html) than i finally fund blogit when i was watching a [luke smith video](https://odysee.com/@Luke:7/soydevs-destroyed-epic-style-by-based:6) but didn't realy think about it until [now](1655060353)
